                <p>Teaching English in China is a great opportunity for those who would like to gain experience teaching, while having the chance to explore a country and a part of the world that is home to some the oldest and most interesting civilizations. China has countless beautiful attractions, some of the worldâ€™s most historic landmarks and a rich culture embedded into so many aspects of the the Chinese lifestyle.<br><br><img src="info.jpg" alt="three-kingdoms-education-information" title="Three Kingdoms Education Information" width="640" height="271">School schedules in China are similar to other countries, however, during summer holidays and winter breaks, our teachers have the opportunities to travel, not only to different parts of China, but also to parts of Asia that would typically  be exceedingly costly travelling from other parts of the world.<br><br>Countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Bali and India, just to name a few, are only a short plane ride from China, and tickets, in most cases, are more affordable than flying domestically within most western countries.</p>

                                <p>Three Kingdoms Education was the first school I worked at when I came to China.  Iâ€™ve been here over 3 years now and I spent my first 2 years working with them. I can really say it was one of the best decisions I made.  When I came to China I didnâ€™t know anything about the world outside Canada and very little about teaching. <br><br>The people at Three Kingdoms really worked with me and helped me learn what I needed to know to become a professional teacher. I currently work for a University in China and I donâ€™t think I could have done it without their encouragement and support. THANKS GUYS!! <b><em>- Lee from Toronto, Ontario</em></b></p>

                                <p>Iâ€™ve been travelling to Asia for the past 6 years and specifically to China for the past 2 years. Iâ€™ve been working at Three Kingdoms for the last 2 semesters now can easily say this is the best school I have worked at in all my time in Asia. Not just the school but I have absolutely fallen in love with this city (Chengdu). <br><br>Most of the people I speak with back home have never heard of it, but it's part of the top 10 up-and-coming city's in China and increasing in population quickly.  I would say Chengdu is the most relaxed city I have visited in China. I used to live in Beijing and Shanghai and the quality of life is definately much better here.<b><em>- Jake from Atlanta, Georgia</em></b></p>
